                Festivals are larger than life celebrations of various things. They occur at regular intervals and helping in breaking the monotony of life. Furthermore, they give you the chance to celebrate the little and big things in life. Festivals are the carriers of peace and joy in the communities. All nations of the world have certain religious and cultural festivals. However, India is one of the largest countries to celebrate numerous festivals. As <b>India is a very cultural and diverse country</b>, so are the festivals. They divide into three general categories of national, religious and seasonal.

              <h5>Types of Indian Festivals</h5>
              <p>
                As we can divide the Indian festivals into national, religious and seasonal, we see how they differ from each other. In general, national festivals are celebrated in honor of reputable people and events. The religious ones follow legends of faiths and their beliefs. The seasonal ones are celebrated with each season that we experience that varies from region to region.

                    Independence Day is celebrated on August 15, 1947. On this day, we received independence from the colonial rule of the British Empire. We celebrate and pay tribute to the revolutionaries who led their lives to make us free from the shackles of British tyranny. Republic Day is celebrated gallantly in New Delhi, our capital. Our defence forces join hands to perform tricks and showcase their power to the public. These Festivals are celebrated across the country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, they help in setting aside the differences of the countrymen and unite each other like never before. The capital of India, New Delhi is the seat of national festivals. For instance, it witnesses the grand parade of the Republic Day. The flag hoisting takes place in New Delhi, which is broadcasted on national television for the whole country to see.

              <h5>Religious Festivals</h5>
              <p>
                Every Indian religious festival has a story behind it. These stories carry a message for all the common men. Most of the Festivals convey the message of peace and the victory of good over evil. Every family prepares delectable preparations and invites guests, relatives and other family members. Families reunite, people enjoy for a few days and then get back with their monotonous lives. They again wait for another year eagerly for the religious Festivals to arrive with the wish to see their loved ones again.
              </p>
              <p>
                The religious festivals are one of the most famous festivals not only throughout India but over the world. Some of the most prominent religious festivals are Diwali, Dussehra, Eid-Ul-Fitr, Christmas, Guru Nanak Jayanti, Holi and many more. Diwali and Holi are the most prominent festivals of the Hindu religion. They are very colorful and full of lights.

                Vijayadashami, also known as Dussehra, Dasara or Dashain, is a major Hindu festival celebrated at the end of Navaratri every year.
                It is marking the triumph of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, over the 10-headed demon king Ravana, who abducted Rama's wife, Sita. The festival's name is derived from the Sanskrit words dasha (“ten”) and hara (“defeat”).

                Diwali, India's biggest and most important holiday of the year, is a festival of lights that celebrates the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil and the human ability to overcome.

                Holi, also known as the Festival of Colours, the Festival of Spring, and the Festival of Love, is an ancient Hindu religious festival and one of the most popular festivals in Hinduism.
                Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last full moon day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month marking the spring, making the date vary with the lunar cycle.
                On the day of Holi, entire streets and towns turn red, green and yellow as people throw colored powder into the air and splash them on others. Each color carries a meaning. Red, for example, symbolizes love and fertility while green stands for new beginnings. People also splash water on each other in celebration.

              <h5>Seasonal Festivals</h5>
              <p>
                Finally, the particular regions of the country celebrate seasonal festivals. For instance, Bihu is a festival of Assam. Likewise, Tamil Nadu celebrates Pongal. In addition, there is Basant Panchami which people celebrate through North India and West Bengal as well.
                Seasonal Festivals generally focus on cultivation or other seasonal phenomena. India is an agricultural country and these Festivals have immense importance in our history. These Festivals generally depict the advent of new harvests. The farmers worship the Gods and Goddesses of agriculture and harvest, wishing good yield for the next year. The amazing fact is that despite the cultural differences, the seasonal Festivals related to harvests are celebrated at the same time of the year.

              <h5>Importance of Festivals</h5>
              <p>
                Festivals are very important. They make us forget our cultural and religious differences. They unite people and they come together for the sole purpose of celebration and happiness. Other than that, festivals also help us embrace our culture and religion. They are very helpful in breaking the monotony of life.
              </p>
              <p>

                These Festivals make India a single entity. It is the beauty of diversified unity that no other country can display. The Festivals are the social glues that keep different communities together despite the social differences and make India stronger. This is the legacy of our country that we have been carrying from one generation to the other for ages.Is this page helpful?

                In short, festivals fill our lives with colors and enthusiasm. They bring us closer every year and eliminate any feelings of communal hatred. Further, they strengthen the bonds of the community and remove the malice from people’s hearts. Therefore, festivals are quite important and must be celebrated with passion.
