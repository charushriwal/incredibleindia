                      <h5>North Indian Food</h5>Food in the north India, to begin with, Kashmiri cuisines reflect strong Central Asian influences. In Kashmir, mostly all the dishes are prepared around the main course of rice found abundantly in the beautiful valley. Another delicious item cooked here is the ‘Saag‘ that is prepared with a green leafy vegetable known as the ‘Hak‘.
                      Amritsari Chole Bhature, Kashmiri Rogan Josh, Rajasthani Dal-Bati Churma, and Dilli ki Chaat are just a few delectable dishes that North Indian cuisine has to offer.
                      In comparison to other cuisines of India, North Indian food is richer, where a number of preparations are made in pure desi ghee or doused in fresh cream. (The world-famous Butter Chicken being the perfect case in point). Some of the dishes take long hours to prepare as they involve meticulous steps, but once you take a bite, you know you are in for a gastronomic joyride. And the best part? You also have simple, comfort food such as Dal Tadkaand Rajma-Chawal that hold a favourite spot in most people's hearts.

                      But on the other hand states like the Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh show high consumption of chapatis as staple food. Again, these chapatis are prepared with a variety of flours such as wheat, rice, maida, besan etc. Besides chapatis other closely related breads baked in these regions include Tandoori, Rumaali and Naan etc. However in the northern region impact of Mughlai food is quite obvious. 
                      North Indians also love dairy items, which is clearly evident as no traditional meal is served without chaas, lassi,paneerand milk-based desserts like kheer, kulfi. Yes, talk about desserts and the wide range of irresistible treats are sure to bowl you over.
                      And then with every changing season as new local produce hit the markets, one can indulge in dishes such as makki ki roti with sarson ka saag, chaulai ki saag, kanji made from black carrots, arbi ki sabji, gajar ka halwa, and others. It is not without reason when people say that the North Indians take their food seriously. Every nook and corner here has many delightful treats to offer.

                      <h5>West Indian Food</h5>The states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa make for the majority of western states of India. Diversity is one thing that is common across these regions - from culture and climate to food, you'll find a variety of it as you move from Rajasthan's Aravalli to the western coastline of Goa.

                      In Goa, that is further down towards south, one can notice Portuguese influence in the cooking style as well as in the dishes. Some of the major dishes of this regiun are the sweet and sour Vindaloo, duck baffad, sorpotel and egg molie etc.
                      Goa, the party destination of India, has a lush, green coastline that provides an abundance of seafood. Since it was a Portuguese colony until the 1960's, there is a heavy influence of it across the flavours of Goan cuisine. With a tropical climate, Goan cuisine is rich in the use of intense spices and flavours along with coconut milk and rice. It borrows a lot from the Konkani food that is predominantly non-vegetarian, fiery and spicy with a hint of coconut.

                      <h5>South Indian Food</h5>
                        In the southern India, the states make great use of spices, fishes and coconuts, as most of them have coastal kitchens. In the foods of Tamil Nadu use of tamarind is frequently made in order to impart sourness to the dishes. It simply distinguishes the Tamil Food from other cuisines.
                        The cooking style of Andhra Pradesh is supposed to make excessive use of chilies, which is obviously to improve the taste of the dishes.
                        In Kerala, some of the delicious dishes are thelamb stew and appams, Malabar fried prawns, Idlis, Dosas, fish molie and rice puttu. Another famous item of this region is the sweetened coconut milk. Yet another dish is Puttu, which is glutinous rice powder steamed like a pudding in a bamboo shoot.
                        By and large, South Indian cuisine is perhaps the hottest of all Indian food. Meals are centered around rice or rice-based dishes. Rice is combined with sambar and rasam, dry and curried vegetables, meat dishes, and a host of coconut-based chutneys and poppadums (deep-fried crispy lentil pancakes).
