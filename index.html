                                    First of all, democracy refers to a system of government where the citizens exercise power by voting. Democracy holds a special place in India. Furthermore, India without a doubt is the biggest democracy in the world. Also, the democracy of India is derived from the constitution of India. After suffering at the hands of British colonial rule, India finally became a democratic nation in 1947. Most noteworthy, Indian democracy since independence is infused with the spirit of justice, liberty, and equality.
                                </p>
                                <h6>Features of Indian Democracy</h6>
                                <p>
                                    Sovereignty is a vital feature of Indian democracy. Sovereignty refers to the full power of a governing body over itself without outside interference. Moreover, people can exercise power in Indian democracy. Most noteworthy, people of India elect their representatives. Moreover, these representatives remain responsible for common people.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The democracy in India works on the principle of political equality. Furthermore, it essentially means all citizens are equal before the law. Most noteworthy, there is no discrimination on the basis of religion, caste, creed, race, sect, etc. Hence, every Indian citizen enjoys equal political rights.
