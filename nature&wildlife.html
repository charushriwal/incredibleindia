              <h2>Wildlife</h2>
              <p>
                India has an abundant heritage of wildlife. Wildlife comprises animals, birds, plants, insects, etc. that are wild and living in a natural environment or forest.
                Wildlife is a natural resource that not only helps in maintaining our ecological balance but is also beneficial from the economic point of view that generates revenue from tourism.
              </p>
              <p>
                The flora and fauna also play a crucial role from recreational and aesthetic points of view. There are about 76000 species of animals in India which encompasses about 82% of known species of the world. 
                India has a large number of varieties of birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians as endemic. They all like to live in forests. But, with the increasing human demands, there is constant interference in wildlife.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to farming, Urbanization, pollution, and other anthropogenic interventions, biodiversity is shrinking. As a result, several animal species have become extinct

                      Wildlife plays important role in balancing our environmental system as well as providing stability to different processes of nature. Wildlife's importance is found in ecological, economic, agriculture, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p><h6>Ecological</h6>It maintains the food chain. If we hunt wild animals like carnivores then there is an increase in the number of herbivores animals. It in turn affects our agricultural lands and destroys the crops. In this way, it affects our food.
                      So, it is a predator of each other to balance the ecological system. In other words, all                
                      species like animals, birds, and others depend on each other. All species contribute to               
                      a balanced nature.

                Tourism is not permitted in a wildlife sanctuary. People are not allowed unescorted there. The main objective of establishing a wildlife sanctuary is to educate humans as to how to treat the animals. The animals are taken care of and allowed to live peacefully in their natural habitats.

                There are a number of reasons for establishing wildlife sanctuaries. Some of the reasons are listed below:
              </P>
              <ol>
                <li>The wildlife sanctuaries are established to protect the endangered species.</li>
                <li>It is quite difficult to always relocate the animals from their natural habitat, therefore, protecting them in their natural environment is advantageous.</li>
                <li>The endangered species are specially monitored in the wildlife sanctuaries. If they reproduce and grow in number while under protection, few specimens can be kept for breeding in the conservation parks for their survival.</li>
                <li>Biologist activities and researches are permitted in the wildlife sanctuaries so that they can learn about the animals living there.</li>
                <li>A few sanctuaries take in injured and abandoned animals and rehabilitate them to health before releasing them in the forest.</li>
                <li>Wildlife sanctuaries preserve the endangered species and protect them from humans and predators.</li>

                    <p>
                      Lakes are those static bodies of water on the land surface which are surrounded by lands on all sides and are always located on the land surface. There is wide range of variation in the size of lakes. Some lakes are as small as ponds having a meagre areal extent of a few square metres while some lakes are as large as the Great Lakes.
                    </p>
              <p>
                Lakes are also called as inland standing water but this is not always true as some lakes are also located along the sea coasts e.g. Chilka lake in Orissa. Lakes are not permanent features on the earth’s surface. Lakes are formed, developed and are ultimately obliterated due to siltation and upliftment of lake beds due to diastrophic movements, for example, several lakes have disappeared in the Kumaun region of Uttaranchal e.g. Sukha Tal (‘tal’ means lake or pond, Sukha Tal means dry lake) and Saria Tal (means rotten lake) around Nainital town. Lakes, thus, may be defined as non-permanent features of static waters on the land surface.

              <h2>Forests</h2>
              <p>
                The forests in India are located primarily in Himalayan region and to some extent in Indo-Gangetic plains and Deccan plateau. The total area under forest in India covers 22.8% of the total geographical area.
                forest area in India is proportionally smaller in comparison to other advanced countries of the world. Our national policy laid down that India as a whole should aim at maintaining one-third of its land under forests, the proportion being 60% in hilly regions and 20% in plains.
              </p>
              <table>

                The main use of forests is for the extraction of timber, and this is always likely to remain the most important use of forests. However, forests have other values which have been increasingly realized in recent years. Among the most important of these is the protection of water resources. Rainfall runs off forested land much more slowly than off cleared land.
              </p>
              <p>
                The trees intercept and retain the moisture on their leaves, or absorb it into their roots and stems, and this ensures a more gradual transfer of water. Soil erosion, caused by rapid run­off, and flooding, caused by too much water en­tering the rivers at one time, are prevented or con­siderably reduced. Water-catchment areas are thus usually protected by a forest cover to prevent ex­cessive run-off.
              </p>
              <p>
                Afforestation may even, in some areas, help to improve the climate. If trees can be planted in dry areas, they can protect the soil from wind erosion, prevent excessive evaporation from bare ground, and add moisture to the atmosphere by transpira­tion, thus slightly modifying humidity conditions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Forests also have great value for recreation. They may be beautiful in themselves or may beautify the landscape by adding variety to agricultural districts. They are pleasant for picnics, walks and other outdoor activities, and if they are associated with lakes, as is often the case in catchment areas, they make excellent parks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Forests are also the homes of many wild animals and birds and these may be watched, as in national parks, or hunted for sport. Forestry and wildlife conservation may go hand in hand in some areas and if properly managed, forests may create a new form of income from tourism.
