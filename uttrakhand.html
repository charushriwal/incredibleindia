He brought with him his painters who first started miniature painting in the region.  Inspired by the natural beauty of the land, the Princeâ€™s painters created many stunning artworks during the era, which continue to inspire many generations of new artists till date. Over the years, the miniature painting artform in Uttarakhand has evolved significantly and has developed a distinct style. However, the majority of the artworks are still inspired by the beauty of the land.</p>
                    <p><b>Aipen-</b> An indigenous Uttarakhand folk art form, Aipen is one of the traditional forms of Rangoli that is practised everywhere in the state. This art has cultural and religious implications in the life of the Kumano community.  Like the different forms of Rangoli practised in India, Aipen involves drawing various repetitive geometric patterns and motifs. There are no strict rules in terms of composition, and the artists have full freedom to express themselves and follow their instincts in creating different styles and patterns.   Another unique thing about this folk art of Uttarakhand is the material used for making Aipen. Unlike other parts of India, where people use colourful powders for making Rangoli, Aipen is used using finely grounded rice that is made into a paste with water. And, the patterns are made with bare hands, against a dark background.</p>
                    <p><b>Wall Paintings-</b> Wall paintings are a famous art form of Uttarakhand that has been an integral part of the local history and culture since years of anonymity. It is omnipresent in Uttarakhand, and is widely appreciated by the art lovers worldwide because of the aesthetic value and its splendour.  The wall paintings are most prominent in the Kumaon and Garhwal regions, and they have a rich tradition which were not known to the world until recently when the art connoisseurs of the world took note of this brilliant art form and its exquisite finesse.</p>

                      Minerals are inorganic substances, which contain one or more elements. Rocks consist of minerals. It is a common believe that Himalaya as a whole are rich in mineral wealth. During the last eighty years or so, a number of geoscientists have been carrying out surveys and prospecting work in different parts of Garhwal hills and besides the metal ores which were already known to common people (Copper, Lead, Zinc, Silver, Gold, Iron ore etc.), a number of new minerals of utility have been located. The widening gap between the presence of minerals at a place and their local non-utilization due to various reasons is the greatest problem in developing the mineral industry in Garhwal hills.

                      Geologically the Nayyar catchments comprise three main litho-tectonic units first as Almora crystalline in the north & northeastern parts covering parts of Thalisain, Bironkhal, Pabo and Pauri, second as Sedimentary belt of Jaunsar, Krol-Tal sequence in Rikhnikhal, Bironkhal and Jahrikhal blocks and third as Shivalik belt. From economic point of view, the Krol limestone is quarried for sugar industry, lime and some refractory. While a few pockets of gypsum are seen in the Krol Limestone. The Phyllites and slates are used as roof tiles and quartzites as building and road materials. A locality of lead and zinc mineralisation is seen in Bironkhal and Thalisain area. River Sand, gravels and bajri are used in building constructions. A few mica flakes are quite large in dimension with in the Almora crystalline and some times excavated by the local people.

                        The climate of Uttarakhand is temperate, marked by seasonal variations in temperature but also affected by tropical monsoons. January is the coldest month, with daily high temperatures averaging below freezing in the north and near 70 Â°F (21 Â°C) in the southeast. In the north, July is the hottest month, with temperatures typically rising from the mid-40s F (about 7 Â°C) to about 70 Â°F daily. In the southeast, May is the warmest month, with daily temperatures normally reaching the low 100s F (about 38 Â°C) from a low around 80 Â°F (27 Â°C). Most of the stateâ€™s roughly 60 inches (1,500 mm) of annual precipitation is brought by the southwest monsoon, which blows from July through September. Floods and landslides are problems during the rainy season in the lower stretches of the valleys. In the northern parts of the state, 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 metres) of snowfall is common between December and March.
